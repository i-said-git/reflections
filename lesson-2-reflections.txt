What happens when you initializea repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository it let's git know that you want to keep
track of the file in the current directory. You need to do this so that
git knows which files and folders you want to track.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The difference is that the working directory is simply the local directory
on your computer that you're going to turn into a repository and a repository
is different because it's where actual commited changes to files are saved.
Staging area is valuable because it gives you a place to put files before
they are ready to be committed.
