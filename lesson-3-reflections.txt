When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I think the best use for a remote repository would be when working on a project from multiple computers and when
when working on a project when working with multiple people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you're working off code from a project that you didn't start and want to
take the codebase in a different direction and not collaborate with the 
original author.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?

A clone is a copy of a repo. A branch is a commit not apart of the master
branch and a fork is a clone made by Github that his linked to the original
author.
